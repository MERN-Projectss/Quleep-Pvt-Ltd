This assignment requires the knowledge of AWS S3. 

Students are expected to use MongoDB but bonus points will be given to students who use dynamoDB.


Make a form similar to a product uploading page in a CMS system.

Example 

* A sample page where flipkart sellers will upload their product images and add product related data like Name , Description Price etc.
* Also upload product images. Candidates have to use S3 as the storage for these images.

### The form will have following fields
* Name [Text]
* Description [Text]
* Price[Text] Currency Drop down.
* File Uploading buttons. Minimum 1 and maximum 6 images can be uploaded per product.


A very basic dashboard where all the uploaded products can be seen with name and first image in a grid.

Complete your project. Host it on a server similar to EC2. And share the URL with us.

No need to send a GitHub link.

There is no deadline as this assignment will reach you at a different time. When you share a URL via mail please mention the time it took to complete the assignment. Your assignment will be judged based on that also. 


False timing information can backfire as if you mention a short duration post joining you will be expected to deliver in that duration and a longer duration may simply reject the application.
